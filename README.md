# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Video Ad Campaign Dashboard

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Video Ad Campaign Dashboard using Claude 3.7 in Cursor's Agent mode. The dashboard was built step-by-step with Claude's assistance, showcasing how AI can help with complex React application development.

## What was implemented

- Complete React dashboard for video ad campaigns using Material UI
- Interactive components including campaign cards, video previews, and metrics charts
- Data visualization with Recharts
- Filtering functionality for campaigns
- Responsive layout following Material Design principles

## How Agent mode was used

Claude 3.7 in Agent mode was able to:
1. Set up the project structure and dependencies
2. Create mock data files from the provided JSON
3. Implement React components with proper state management
4. Design a responsive UI with Material UI components
5. Add data visualization with charts
6. Fix ESLint warnings and improve code quality

## Key benefits demonstrated

- Rapid prototyping of a complex React application
- Consistent code style and organization
- Proper implementation of React hooks and state management
- Clean component architecture with separation of concerns
- Detailed documentation through comments

## Note on ESLint warnings

There are a few ESLint warnings that could be addressed in a follow-up PR:
- Unused variables in DashboardSummary, FilterBar, and MetricsChart
- Missing dependency in useEffect hook in Dashboard.js
