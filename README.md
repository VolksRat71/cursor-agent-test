# Video Ad Campaign Dashboard

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Video Ad Campaign Dashboard using Claude 3.7 in Cursor's Agent mode. The dashboard was built step-by-step with Claude's assistance, showcasing how AI can help with complex React application development.

## What was implemented

- Complete React dashboard for video ad campaigns using Material UI
- Interactive components including campaign cards, video previews, and metrics charts
- Data visualization with Recharts
- Filtering functionality for campaigns
- Responsive layout following Material Design principles

## How Agent mode was used

Claude 3.7 in Agent mode was able to:
1. Set up the project structure and dependencies
2. Create mock data files from the provided JSON
3. Implement React components with proper state management
4. Design a responsive UI with Material UI components
5. Add data visualization with charts
6. Fix ESLint warnings and improve code quality

## Key benefits demonstrated

- Rapid prototyping of a complex React application
- Consistent code style and organization
- Proper implementation of React hooks and state management
- Clean component architecture with separation of concerns
- Detailed documentation through comments

## Note on ESLint warnings

There are a few ESLint warnings that could be addressed in a follow-up PR:
- Unused variables in DashboardSummary, FilterBar, and MetricsChart
- Missing dependency in useEffect hook in Dashboard.js
